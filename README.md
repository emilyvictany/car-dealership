## Service microservice

Purpose of this microservice is to keep track of service appointments for automobiles and their owners.

##### Models:
* Technician: first name, last name, and employee id
* AutomobileVO: will poll the 'vin' and 'sold' fields from Automobile model in inventory and will be used for the special feature.
* Appointment: Keeps track of date/time, reason, status, vin, customer name, technician (selected from technician model), and will gather extra data to compare if the customer's vin matches a vin from the automobileVO so that we know if they are a VIP.

##### Special Feature:
* If the VIN in the appointment matches a VIN from the AutomobileVO, then it means that it was sold through us and are considered a VIP.

## Sales microservice

The purpose of this microservice is to keep track of automobile sales that come from the inventory. A salesperson cannot sell a car that isn't list in the inventory, nor can they sell a car that has already been sold.

On the backend, I created models for Salesperson, Customer, Sale, and Automobile VO. Implemented a poller to poll automobile data from the inventory. Created React components on the frontend allowing user to add a Salesperson, list all Salespeople, add a Customer, list all Customers, add a new Sale, list all Sales, and view a salesperson's sale history.

##### Models:
* Salesperson: first name, last name, and employee ID
* Customer: first name, last name, address, and phone number
* Sale: price, automobile, salesperson, and customer. Created a special feature to ensure that only automobiles that have not been sold are available to sell.
* AutomobileVO: works with the poller to pole the VIN and sold status. This is what makes the special feature possible


## Getting Started
*for this project we used git, Docker, and Insomnia*

* Fork from repository at https://gitlab.com/emilyvictany/car-dealership
* Setup Gitlab if you need to add members
* Clone with `git clone` to your local computer
    * Use HTTPS if SSH has not been set up
	* after cloning, we used `code .` to open project in **VS Code**
* Run the following commands in **Docker** on your computer
    1. `docker volume create beta-data`
    2.  `docker-compose build`
    3.  `docker-compose up`


## Inventory Monolith CRUD
* Build a CRUD for the Inventory Monolith

<summary markdown="span">Creating a sale</summary>

To create a sale, we use the automobile's VIN for the automobile, the employee's ID for the salesperson, and the customer's ID for customer.

After every successful sale, a PUT request is sent to the Inventory microservice to update an automobile's sold status. This integration ensures that a salesperson cannot list a car that has already been sold.

Here is an example of a JSON body to send:

```
{
    "price": "32456",
    "automobile": "1J4FF48S6YL241653",
    "salesperson": "SMitchell",
	"customer": "1"
}
```

```
{
	"id": 1,
